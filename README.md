# Custom MAC unit deployment in Neural Network

This project explores the integration of neural networks directly into hardware platforms for efficient, real-time character recognition. Using the **MNIST dataset** (70,000+ labeled images), we design and implement an **on-chip neural network (NN)** that classifies handwritten digits for applications such as automated document processing, digital assistants, and biometric authentication.
